# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness App Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for my **Fitness App**, a full-stack web project designed to offer a modern fitness app which is platform independent and offers all features needed to reach your goals. 💪📈

This backend provides powerful features to support a fitness journey, including:  
✅ **Calorie Calculator**  
✅ **Workout Plan Creation**  
✅ **Workout Tracking**  
✅ **Weight Management (Loss/Gain)**  
…and much more!

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **[Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/):** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.  
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/):** A flexible and scalable NoSQL database for data storage.

## 💡 Project Idea  

The goal of this project is to master a **TypeScript-based stack** for web development. The backend is built using **Nest.js** and **MongoDB**, while the frontend (check out its own [repository](#)) leverages **Angular** for an amazing user experience.

By combining **fitness** and **coding**, this project is a reflection of my two passions, offering an app that’s both fun to build and practical to use. 💻❤️💪
